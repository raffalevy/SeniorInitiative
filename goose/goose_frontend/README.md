The Goose Programming Language - Frontend
========================================



This is a specification and compiler frontend for Goose, the programming language I am creating.

* [`specs/syntax.md`](specs/syntax.md) contains an informal reference for the language's syntax.

* [`specs/grammar.md`](specs/grammar.md) contains a specification of the language's parsing grammar.
